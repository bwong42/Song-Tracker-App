# My Personal Project

## Song Learning Tracker

- **What will the application do?**

The application will help people keep track of songs that they are learning on a large choice of instruments. This will help them organize songs into songs that they want to learn, currently learning and already finished learning. They will also be able to keep track for how many days that they have been learning a particular song.

- **Who will use it?**

The people who use it would be people who play instruments and is continually learning new songs. This can be helpful for students and also casual instrument players who are continually learning new songs.

- **Why is this project of interest to you?**

This project is of interest to me because I personally play guitar and am continually learning new songs. One of the problems that I encountered is that I lost track of the songs that I want to learn, currently learning, and have already learned. I would find it super helpful to have an application for every song that I have learned.
